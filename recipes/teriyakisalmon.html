        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Teriyaki sauce might be one of the most well-known flavor profiles that comes out of Japan - it's salty and sweet and 
        caramelizes great when on grilled dishes. Salmon is also a very popular fish in Japanese cuisine, so the two together are a 
        natural pair.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salmon, skin-on cut into 1 and half inch portions.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce of good quality</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of mirin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sake</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon cornstarch to thicken(optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients - besides the salmon - in a bowl. If using cornstarch, make a slurry of it first with a 
            couple tablespoons of water for when you cook the sauce. Set aside mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pan to medium. If you'd like, grease pan to help salmon not stick.</li>
            <li>Place skin side down to attain crispy skiin. Leave for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn over to opposite side and put a 2 tablespoons of water and pinch of salt in pan, cover and let steam for 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove salmon and put other ingredients into pan, still on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Put sauce mixture into pan until it starts to thicken. If you would like it to thicken more, stir in cornstarch
            slurry slowly.</li>
            <li>Return salmon to pan and pour sauce over a few times.</li>
            <li> Plate up the salmon and enjoy with your favorite sidedish!</li>
