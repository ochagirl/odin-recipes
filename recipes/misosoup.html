                <p>Simple yet filling traditional Japanese soup made with fermented soybean paste. It also pairs well with just about any 
                Japanese dish. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Serves two people as a side dish.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups dashi stock (either homemade or from dashi packet)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons white, yellow, or red miso paste</li>
                    <li>1 cup silken (or your favorite firmness) tofu, cut into 1/2 inch chunks</li>
                    <li>1/2 to 1 tablespoon wakama seaweed for an addition to soup</li>
                    <li>(optional) thinly-sliced scallions as a garnish</li>
                
                </ul> 
                
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>In a pot, bring the dashi to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Add cubed tofu and seaweed. You simply want to heat the tofu through.</li>
                    <li>When adding miso, do not just drop the paste into the water. "Pre-mix" the miso with a small amout of soup liquid
                    in another container (even a ladle or large spoon will do) so there are no clumps of miso floating in soup. Miso is usually very
                    salty!</li>
                    <li>Quickly after adding the miso, turn off the heat to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Serve in two small soup bowls and garnish with scallions.</li>
                </ol>
